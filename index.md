I write and teach about the modern United States, with a focus on social movements, culture wars, and politics.  My latest book is [Red Dynamite: Creationism, Culture Wars, and Anticommunism in America](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501759291/red-dynamite/#bookTabs=1) (Cornell University Press, 2021). My first book was [Labor, Loyalty, and Rebellion: Southwestern Illinois Coal Miners and World War I](http://siupress.com/books/978-0-8093-2635-8) (Southern Illinois University Press, 2005). In addition to teaching in the [history department](https://history.indiana.edu/index.html) about the controversy over evolutionary science, I also offer courses on leadership, social movements, and public policy as part of the Political and Civic Engagement [(PACE)](https://pace.indiana.edu/index.html) Program and a course on the history and politics of meat in the Liberal Arts and Management Program [(LAMP)](https://lamp.indiana.edu/).  I have also co-taught a course on the history of mathematics.  In my spare time, I play jazz and classical clarinet.
