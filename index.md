I was born in Chicago and grew up in nearby Oak Park, Illinois. I write and teach at [Indiana University-Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/) about the modern United States, with a focus on social movements, culture wars, and politics.  My latest book is [Red Dynamite: Creationism, Culture Wars, and Anticommunism in America](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501759291/red-dynamite/#bookTabs=1) (Cornell University Press, 2021). My first book was [Labor, Loyalty, and Rebellion: Southwestern Illinois Coal Miners and World War I](http://siupress.com/books/978-0-8093-2635-8) (Southern Illinois University Press, 2005). In addition to teaching in the [history department](https://history.indiana.edu/index.html) about the controversy over evolutionary science, I also offer courses on leadership, social movements, and public policy as part of the Political and Civic Engagement [(PACE)](https://pace.indiana.edu/index.html) Program and a course on the history and politics of meat in the Liberal Arts and Management Program [(LAMP)](https://lamp.indiana.edu/).  I have also co-taught a course on the history of mathematics.  Over the past five years, I've been involved in promoting the pedagogy of [Reacting to the Past](https://reacting.barnard.edu/) role-playing games in the classroom. In my spare time, I play [jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uftOaK4ykDw) and [classical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_SvS_GdvSE) clarinet.

I created this website as a way to share "cutting-room floor" material that I had written or collected that never made it into *Red Dynamite*. Hence, "deleted scenes" and "image outtakes." I'll also be sharing thoughts on current events related to the issues raised by the book in my blog posts. Finally, I'll be posting media coverage and news of public events I schedule. I look forward to the conversations sparked by *Red Dynamite*.
